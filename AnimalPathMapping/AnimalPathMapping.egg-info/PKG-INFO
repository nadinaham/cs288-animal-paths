AnimalPathMapping: a Python package for autonomously labeling animal paths in RGB and LiDAR imagery taken by the Davies lab of conservation sites in Africa.

Getting started (note that every time you modify the code and want to run it, you'll have to do this):
To install the package, complete the following steps:
1. cd into the root directory of this package (the outer-level AnimalPathMapping folder)
2. activate the conda environment: "conda activate /n/davies_lab/Lab/shared_conda_envs/AnimalPathMapping"
    - if you do not have access to this environment, create your own conda environment with the packages listed in requirements.txt
3. run the command "python setup.py sdist"
    - this should create our distribution package and egg-info (you should see the folders 'dist/' and 'AnimalPathMapping.egg-info/' with our package in 'dist/')
    - after this step, our package can be installed with pip
4. run the command "pip install ./dist/AnimalPathMapping-0.0.1.tar.gz"
    - if this doesn't work, check the name of the .tar.gz file inside of the 'dist/' folder and replace 'AnimalPathMapping-0.0.1.tar.gz' with that file name, including the file extension.
    - if this was successful, you should be able to open a Python interpreter somewhere outside our project directory and use our package
    - TODO make a file to run to test if its working

TODO: in the future: make a bash.rc file that does steps 2-4 automatically (would have to find the file name created inside "dist/").  Then update the instructions here to run that bash file and then our testing suite/at the very least a greeting file to make sure that the package can run.
